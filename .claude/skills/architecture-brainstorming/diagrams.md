# Diagram catalog

Pick by **the question currently on the table**. If no question is open, no diagram is
needed.

**On Mermaid's C4 support:** `C4Context` / `C4Container` blocks exist but are still
experimental and render inconsistently across viewers. Use `flowchart` with C4
conventions instead — person, system, external system, styled by `classDef`. Same
information, renders everywhere.

---

## 1. System context

**Q:** What is this system, who uses it, what does it depend on — and what is *not* ours?
**Draw when:** starting anything new, or when scope is being argued.
**Skip when:** adding a feature inside a system whose boundary is already settled.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    student([Student]):::person
    teacher([Teacher]):::person
    roster[["Roster — lab & group management"]]:::system
    github[("GitHub — repos, org membership")]:::external

    student -->|"joins a group, submits work"| roster
    teacher -->|"creates labs, reviews groups"| roster
    roster -->|"creates repos, reads members (REST)"| github

    classDef person fill:#08427b,color:#fff
    classDef system fill:#1168bd,color:#fff
    classDef external fill:#777,color:#fff
```

**Wrong-diagram tell:** you're drawing boxes that live *inside* your system. That's §2.

## 2. Container

**Q:** What separately-runnable pieces exist, and over what protocol do they talk?
**Draw when:** almost always. The highest value-per-minute diagram there is.
**Skip when:** single process, single binary, no datastore.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    teacher([Teacher])
    subgraph roster["Roster"]
        spa["apps/www — React SPA (Vite)"]
        api["apps/api — Hono Worker"]
        d1[("D1 — SQLite")]
    end
    gh[("GitHub API")]

    teacher -->|HTTPS| spa
    spa -->|"RPC over fetch, typed via AppType"| api
    api -->|"Drizzle queries"| d1
    api -->|"REST, only from lib/github/"| gh
```

**Wrong-diagram tell:** two boxes that always deploy together and share a process —
they're components, not containers. That's §3.

## 3. Component

**Q:** Inside one container, what are the major parts and where does new code go?
**Draw when:** a container is growing, or a placement convention is being decided.
**Skip when:** the container has one obvious module.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    routes["routes/ — paths + middleware"] --> handlers["handlers/ — request logic"]
    handlers --> lib["lib/ — named units"]
    lib --> ghlib["lib/github/ — one call + narrowing per fn"]
```

**Wrong-diagram tell:** you're naming functions. That's §4, and it's usually not worth
drawing.

## 4. Code

**Q:** How do these specific types relate?
**Draw when:** a genuinely intricate relationship — a variance problem, a state-carrying
hierarchy. Rare.
**Skip when:** almost always. The IDE generates this on demand and it goes stale fastest.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Reconciler { <<interface>> +reconcile(ctx) Result }
    Reconciler <|.. GroupReconciler
    Reconciler <|.. RepoReconciler
```

## 5. System architecture

**Q:** What does the whole solution look like, cloud services and all?
**Draw when:** infrastructure is part of the design — queues, CDNs, buckets, auth
providers, schedulers.
**Skip when:** it would be §2 with logos on it. Only draw this if infra choices are
genuinely under discussion.

Same form as §2, plus the managed services and the edges to them, grouped by provider
or by environment.

**Wrong-diagram tell:** every box is a vendor logo and no arrow says what flows. Label
the edges or delete the diagram.

## 6. Sequence

**Q:** In what order does this happen, who calls whom, and where can it fail midway?
**Draw when:** ordering *is* the design — auth flows, webhooks, retries, multi-step
writes, anything with a partial-failure window.
**Skip when:** one call, one response.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor S as Student
    participant W as SPA
    participant A as API
    participant G as GitHub
    S->>W: click "join group"
    W->>A: POST /groups/:id/join
    A->>G: add collaborator
    G-->>A: 201
    A-->>W: group + members
    Note over A,G: GitHub call fails → membership row must not be written
```

Put the failure note in. The happy path was never the reason to draw this.

## 7. State machine

**Q:** What states can this entity be in, what transitions are legal, and what's
unreachable?
**Draw when:** anything with a lifecycle — invitations, jobs, submissions, subscriptions.
Very high value, very under-drawn.
**Skip when:** the thing has two states and one transition.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> invited
    invited --> accepted: student accepts
    invited --> expired: 7 days elapse
    accepted --> removed: teacher removes
    expired --> [*]
    removed --> [*]
```

**Payoff:** this is what stops `isLoading` and `isError` both being true. If the diagram
has one state per boolean combination, the state should be one field, not N booleans.

## 8. Entity-relationship

**Q:** What do we store, what owns what, and what does the cardinality actually mean?
**Draw when:** new tables, or a relationship anyone had to ask about twice.
**Skip when:** adding a column.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CLASS ||--o{ LAB : contains
    LAB ||--o{ GROUP : has
    GROUP }o--o{ USER : "membership"
```

Say the cardinality out loud while drawing — "a group has many users, a user is in many
groups" — that sentence is where the wrong assumption surfaces.

## 9. Data flow with trust boundaries

**Q:** Where does untrusted data enter, where is it validated, and what crosses a
boundary unchecked?
**Draw when:** user input, third-party payloads, webhooks, file uploads, anything
security-relevant. **This doubles as the threat model.**
**Skip when:** all data originates inside the system.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph untrusted["untrusted"]
        u([User input])
        wh([GitHub webhook])
    end
    subgraph trusted["trusted — our worker"]
        v["zod validation (drizzle-zod)"]
        h["handler"]
        db[("D1")]
    end
    u -->|"raw JSON body"| v
    wh -->|"payload + HMAC signature"| v
    v -->|"typed, validated"| h
    h --> db
```

**Wrong-diagram tell:** no boundary drawn. Then it's §2 with different words — the
boundary is the entire point.

## 10. Deployment

**Q:** What runs where, what fails together, and where does the latency come from?
**Draw when:** multiple environments, regions, or availability requirements.
**Skip when:** one region, one platform, no ops question open.

Nodes as `subgraph`s (region / edge / origin), containers inside them, edges labeled
with protocol *and* rough latency where it matters.

## 11. Dependency graph

**Q:** What may import what?
**Draw when:** setting or defending layering rules. Its output becomes a
`project-conventions` rule directly.
**Skip when:** two modules.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    routes --> handlers --> lib --> db["@roster/db"]
    www["apps/www"] -.->|"FORBIDDEN"| db
    linkStyle 3 stroke:#c00,stroke-dasharray:4
```

Draw the **forbidden** edges too, marked. A dependency diagram showing only what's
allowed doesn't say what it's protecting against.

## 12. User flow

**Q:** How many steps, decisions, and dead ends does the user actually face?
**Draw when:** a multi-screen flow, or when the product shape is what's disputed.
**Skip when:** one screen.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    a["Open lab"] --> b{"In a group?"}
    b -->|no| c["Browse open groups"] --> d{"Seats free?"}
    d -->|no| e["Waitlist"]
    d -->|yes| f["Join"]
    b -->|yes| g["Group view"]
```

Often settles a design argument faster than any architecture diagram, because it's the
only one the non-engineers in the room can check.

## 13. Option comparison

**Q:** Which of these approaches?
**Draw when:** the options differ *structurally*. Two small diagrams side by side beat
two paragraphs.
**Skip when:** they differ only in a library choice — that's a sentence.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph A["Option A — sync in handler"]
        a1["handler"] --> a2["GitHub"] --> a3[("D1")]
    end
    subgraph B["Option B — queue"]
        b1["handler"] --> b2[["queue"]] --> b3["worker"] --> b4["GitHub"]
    end
```

State the deciding trade-off under it in one line — not a feature matrix.

## 14. Phasing

**Q:** What ships first, and what blocks what?
**Draw when:** the plan has 4+ phases or a real dependency order.
**Skip when:** three sequential steps — a numbered list is clearer.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    p1["1 · schema + migration"] --> p2["2 · API handlers"]
    p1 --> p3["3 · seed + fixtures"]
    p2 --> p4["4 · SPA screens"]
    p3 --> p4
```

Put the riskiest unknown in phase 1. If it's late in the graph, the graph is wrong.
