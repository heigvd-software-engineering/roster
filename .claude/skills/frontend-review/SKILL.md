description: Use when reviewing the QUALITY of React/frontend code in this project (apps/www) — readability, organization, naming, component structure, rendering, and performance — on the current diff or across the codebase. Not for correctness bug-hunting (use code-review) or answering questions about code (use code-qa).

# Frontend review

Opinionated quality review for the labs React SPA (`apps/www`): is the code
well-organized, well-named, readable, and optimized? Grounded in a sourced
`checklist.md`. Reports findings; only edits with `--fix`.

Not a bug hunt — that's `code-review`. This is readability, structure, and waste.

## Scope (default = the diff — cheap)

- `/frontend-review` → the working diff: `git diff HEAD` (fall back to `git diff @{upstream}...HEAD`).
- `/frontend-review all` → all of `apps/www/app`.
- `/frontend-review <path>` → that file or folder.
- Add `--fix` to apply the safe findings after reporting. Add one lens name to run just that lens.

Only `.tsx`/`.ts` under `apps/www` are in scope. If the scope has none, say so and stop.

## The four lenses

Each maps to a section of `checklist.md` — **read that section, don't review from memory**:

1. **render** — purity, rules-of-hooks, you-might-not-need-an-effect, state shape
2. **perf** — hoist static data, stable keys, lazy routes, anti-cargo-cult memoization
3. **structure** — one-component-per-file, decomposition, composition over prop-drilling, AHA, reuse the primitives, simplification
4. **organization** — colocation, feature islands, naming, domain vocabulary, `cn()` / wrap-raw-Tailwind, inferred types

## Run it (keep it cheap)

1. **Resolve scope** to a concrete file list. Skip a lens whose files aren't in scope (no route files → skip the lazy-route check).
2. **Fan out, in one message:**
   - *Diff or one folder:* one agent per lens over the scope.
   - *`all` / many folders:* one agent per feature folder, each running all four lenses over that folder — bounds cost to the folder count.
   Give each agent: the file list, its lens section from `checklist.md`, and the output contract below. Tight prompts, compact returns.
3. **Merge:** dedup findings on the same line/mechanism, drop anything biome or lint already flags, rank most-impactful first.
4. **Report** grouped by lens. With `--fix`, apply only the safe ones (skip anything that changes behavior or reaches outside the scope), then re-verify with `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm run biome`.

## Output contract (per finding)

`file:line` · **lens** · one-line issue · the concrete cost · the fix. No restating the code, no preamble. End with a one-line verdict (e.g. "6 findings: 2 structure, 3 organization, 1 perf — none blocking"). Empty scope or already-clean code → say so plainly. A short report is a good report.
